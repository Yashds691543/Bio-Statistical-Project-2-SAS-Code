Here we are going to test if there is association between type of therapy and cell type. We are going to use the logistic regression.
Step1: Hypothesis
	- H0: There is no association between type of therapy and cell type
	vs
	- H1: There is association between type of therapy and cell type
Step2: 
	- Significant level alpha = 0.05
Step3: 
	- Attach 2-1
	proc logistic data=finalproject;
		class cell(ref="Large")/param=ref;
		model therapy(event="test")=cell;
	run;
	- From the result above, the p-value is 0.0089
	- We have taken cell type Large as the reference.
Step4:
	- From the results above, the Wald chi-sq value is 9.4398 with degrees of freedom 2 and the associated p-value is 0.0089 which is less than the alpha value 0.05.
Step5: 
	- As the p-value is 0.0089 is less than the alpha value 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that there is significant association between type of therapy and cell type.
	
Now we are going to test specific association of Cell (AdenoVsLarge) and Therapy.

Step1: Hypothesis
	- H0: BcellAvsL = 0
	vs
	- H1: BcellAvsL not equals to zero
Step2: 
	- Significant level alpha = 0.05
Step3: 
	- Attach 2-2
	proc logistic data=finalproject;

Step4:
	- From the results above, the Wald chi-sq value is 4.5248 with degrees of freedom 1 and the associated p-value is 0.0334 which is less than the alpha value 0.05.
Step5: 
	- As the p-value is 0.0334 is less than the alpha value 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that the log odds of association of therapy and cell type Adeno is different from cell type Large.
	
Now we are going to test specific association of Cell (SquamousVsLarge) and Therapy.

Step1: Hypothesis
	- H0: BcellSvsL = 0
	vs
	- H1: BcellSvsL not equals to zero
Step2: 
	- Significant level alpha = 0.05
Step3: 
	- Attach 2-2
	proc logistic data=finalproject;
		class cell(ref="Large")/param=ref;

	run;
	- From the result above, the p-value is 0.2830
Step4:
	- From the results above, the Wald chi-sq value is 1.1526 with degrees of freedom 1 and the associated p-value is 0.2830 which is greater than the alpha value 0.05.
Step5: 
	- As the p-value is 0.2830 is greater than the alpha value 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that the log odds of association of therapy and cell type Squamous not so different from cell type Large.
	
From the above conclusions we can say that (Interpretation of regression coefficients),

The log odds of therapy is 0.4899 more in paitents with Cell Type Adeno compared to Cell type Large.
The log odds of therapy is 0.2242 more in paitents with Cell Type Squamous compared to Cell type Large.

Step4:
	- From the results above, the Wald chi-sq value is 8.9222 with degrees of freedom 2 and the associated p-value is 0.0115 which is less than the alpha value 0.05.
Step5: 
	- As the p-value is 0.0115 is less than the alpha value 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that there is significant effect of Cell type on KPS.

4.
First we are going to model the crude relationship between the Type of therapy and KPS.
I have taken Standard therapy type as reference.
Attach 4-1
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy /solution;
run;

From the above result, as the p value is less than 0.05, we can conclude that there is a relation between the Type of therapy and KPS.

Next I will check for the interaction for each potential variables.

Attach 4-2
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard") cell(ref="Large");
model kps=therapy cell therapy*cell /solution;
run;

As there is one significant interaction term which is BTherapy*Cell(SquamousVsLarge), so the overall interaction is significant.

Attach 4-3
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy age therapy*age /solution;
run;

As the p value (0.9813) of the interaction term is greater than 0.05, the interaction is insignificant.

Attach 4-5
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy time therapy*time /solution;
run;
As the p value (0.8277) of the interaction term is greater than 0.05, the interaction is insignificant.

Attach 4-6
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard") status(ref="0");
model kps=therapy status therapy*status /solution;
run;
As the p value (0.6625) of the interaction term is greater than 0.05, the interaction is insignificant.

Attach 4-7
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy diagtime therapy*diagtime /solution;
run;
As the p value (0.9210) of the interaction term is greater than 0.05, the interaction is insignificant.

Attach 4-8
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard") prior(ref="no");
model kps=therapy prior therapy*prior /solution;
run;
As the p value (0.1812) of the interaction term is greater than 0.05, the interaction is insignificant.

Now we check for cofounding
Attach 4-1

Attach 4-4
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy age /solution;
run;

%change = [(-6.00729164--6.39358974)/-6.00729164)]*100 = 6.4258% < 10%
So, age is not considered as the cofounder.

Attach 4-9
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy time /solution;
run;

%change = [(-7.27007235--6.39358974)/-7.27007235)]*100 = 12.05% > 10%
So, time is considered as the cofounder.

Attach 4-10
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard") status(ref="0");
model kps=therapy status /solution;
run;

%change = [(-6.17189650--6.39358974)/-6.17189650)]*100 = -3.5921% < 10%
So, status is not considered as the cofounder.

Attach 4-11
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard");
model kps=therapy diagtime /solution;
run;

%change = [(-7.17268261--6.39358974)/-7.17268261)]*100 = 10.86% > 10%
So, diagtime is considered as the cofounder.

Attach 4-12
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard") prior(ref="no");
model kps=therapy prior /solution;
run;

%change = [(-6.58187135--6.39358974)/-6.58187135)]*100 = 2.8609% < 10%
So, prior is not considered as the cofounder.

So, the final model is 

Attach 4-13
proc glm data=finalproject;
class therapy(ref="standard") cell(ref="Large");
model kps=therapy cell therapy*cell time diagtime/solution;
run;

Prediction equation is:
kps = 68.64-14.59therapy(TvsSt)-8.48cell(AvsL)-11.29(SvsL)+7.49(therapy(TvsSt)*cell(AvsL))+13.21(therapy(TvsSt)*cell(SvsL))+0.03time-0.31diagtime

Interpretation of regression coefficients:
Interpreting kps for therapy type of test (non-reference level so we take it as 1):
kps = 68.64-14.59(1)-8.48cell(AvsL)-11.29(SvsL)+7.49(1*cell(AvsL))+13.21(1*cell(SvsL))+0.03time-0.31diagtime
	= 68.64-14.59+7.49+13.21-8.48cell(AvsL)-11.29(SvsL)+7.49cell(AvsL)+13.21cell(SvsL)+0.03time-0.31diagtime
	= 74.75-0.99cell(AvsL)+1.92cell(SvsL)+0.03time-0.31diagtime

For the therapy type Test, the kps for cell type Adeno is 0.99 times less than cell type Large with increase in 0.03 days and decrease in 0.31 waiting days.

For the therapy type Test, the kps for cell type Squamous is 1.92 times higher than cell type Large with increase in 0.03 days and decrease in 0.31 waiting days.

Interpreting kps for therapy type of Standard (non-reference level so we take it as 0):
kps = 68.64-14.59(0)-8.48cell(AvsL)-11.29(SvsL)+7.49(0*cell(AvsL))+13.21(0*cell(SvsL))+0.03time-0.31diagtime
	= 68.64-8.48cell(AvsL)-11.29(SvsL)+0.03time-0.31diagtime

For the therapy type Standard, the kps for cell type Adeno is 8.48 times less than cell type Large with increase in 0.03 days and decrease in 0.31 waiting days.

For the therapy type Standard, the kps for cell type Squamous is 11.29 times less than cell type Large with increase in 0.03 days and decrease in 0.31 waiting days.
